## Yo!

My name is Nitai Nandi, but you can call me Maie.
I really like writing code! Currently still learning things, trying to find many ways to practice.

## Highlighted Personal Projects:

### [Genshin Team Manager](https://github.com/Maie-r/GenshinTeamManager)

An application that lists your teams with their total damage output, in different situations, and can pair two teams for you to use in the Spiral Abyss!<br>
My first time using Blazor Hybrid, really liked using it!

### [Local Tier List](https://github.com/Maie-r/Local-Tier-List)

A Tier List Maker that stores tierlists locally on your machine.
This was the second project using Blazor Hybrid, so I had an easier time, did it super fast, and that's why it is still rough around the edges. The reason I developed this was not only to gain more experience about Blazor, but also because I wanted to have an easier way to pull up my tier lists to show to my friends, just opening an app instead of looking up for a site or a screenshot haha.
